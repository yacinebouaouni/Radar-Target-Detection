# Radar-Target-Detection

This Project's objective is to apply 2D CA-CFAR (Constant false alarm rate) to detect a target range and velocity.

## CA-CFAR :
Constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection refers to a common form of adaptive algorithm used in radar systems to detect target returns against a background of noise, clutter and interference.

## Results :
